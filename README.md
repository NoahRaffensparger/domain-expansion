# Domain Expansion

This is a small project I created that uses multiple API's to cross reference available domains with recent top google searches. 

## Setup

You will need to create a .env file that contains a name api token and a serpapi token. If you want the domains sent to your email, you'll have to setup a passcode through gmail.
